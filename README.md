# StartCoding.dev

A simplified [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) / [woofjs](https://woofjs/.com) like environment for learning to code. Currently planned for JavaScrip

## **Mission**

To create a WoofJS like environment, supporting javascript as well as front and backend functionality

## **Planned Components**

1. An underlying set of primitives written in JavaScript that mirror WoofJS / Scratch interfaces and functionality
2. Coding environment that exposes primitives and allows for development in supported languages
3. Intelligent support for syntax and runtime errors through server based static code analysis tools
4. WebGL based rendering for improved graphics performance
6. Additional functionality for data persistence through an ORM like interface
