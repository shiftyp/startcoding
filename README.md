# StartCoding.dev

A simplified [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) / [woofjs](https://woofjs/.com) like environment for learning to code. Currently planned for JavaScript and Python

## **Mission**

To create a WoofJS like environment, supporting multiple languages as well as front and backend functionality

## **Planned Components**

1. An underlying set of primitives written in JavaScript that mirror WoofJS / Scratch interfaces and functionality
2. Coding environment that exposes primitives and allows for development in supported languages
3. Intelligent support for syntax and runtime errors through server based static code analysis tools
4. WebGL based rendering for improved graphics performance
5. Server based WebAssembly compiler for supported languages
6. Additional functionality for data persistence through an ORM like interface

## **Documentation**
