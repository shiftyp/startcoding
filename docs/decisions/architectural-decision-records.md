# Documenting Architectural Decisions as ADR's

## Context and Problem Statement

To provide lightweight documentation for collaboration

## Decision Drivers

Fast documentation, descriptive, with minimal to no editing

## Considered Options

* ADR's

## Decision Outcome

ADR's were the only considered option. Additional types of documentation may and probably will be added at a later time

### Consequences

* Good, quick records of decisions committed with code
* Bad, Requires reading through commits and multiple ADR's to get context
